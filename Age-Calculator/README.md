# Age Calculator
The Age Calculator is a web application developed in PHP that allows users to calculate their age. It leverages PHP's datetime functions to determine a person's age based on the provided date of birth.

## Features
- Date Validation: The application checks whether the user has entered a date of birth and ensures that it is in the correct format.

- Age Calculation: Using the diff() function in PHP, the application calculates the difference between the current date and the entered date of birth, providing the user's accurate age.

## How it Works
- Open the Age Calculator web application in your web browser.

- Enter your date of birth in the specified format.

- Click the "Calculate Age" button.

- The application will validate the date of birth and, if it's in the correct format, will calculate and display your age.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Set up a web server with PHP support. You can use tools like XAMPP, MAMP, or any web server of your choice.
